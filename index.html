			In case you haven't figured it out yet, I'm a pretty quiet person in a new crowd.
			However, once I'm comfortable, my true energetic, goofy, fun-loving side comes out- so be prepared!
		</p>
		<p class="p2">
			BRACE YOURSELVES! for the real me. I'm sure you'll do fine though. Just laugh at the corny jokes (or don't!).
			I grew up on a cattle ranch in Moriarty, NM, and I still fondly remember the days of chasing cows on foot when I wasn't big enough to ride a horse.
			In the agricultural lifestyle, you are constantly learning on the go. Often times school was paused so we could learn about fixing fence or a broken water pipe.
			There was a lot 'unknown' but it always made for interesting days and good life lessons learned.
		</p>
		<p class="p3">
			Besides ranch work, I enjoy playing a variety of music (although my main instrument is fiddle). I've also taught in most of those capacities as well.
			I enjoy yard work and being outdoors and getting sunburnt as a result (mainly because I'm forgetful about sunscreen!)
			I'm currently attempting to learn French, am a published author, and strive daily to be the best dragon possible.
